# Spotify Analysis â€“ Charlie Puthâ€™s Music Trends ðŸŽµ

## Overview  
This project analyzes Charlie Puth's music trends using Spotify API data, AWS (Lambda, S3, RDS), Python, MySQL (RDS), and Tableau.

## Technologies Used  
- **AWS Lambda (Python)**: Handling API calls, fetching and processing Spotify data
- **S3 & RDS**: Storing structured data  
- **MySQL**: Cleaning, transforming, and analyzing data  
- **Tableau**: Creating visualizations and dashboards for insights

## Process  
1. **AWS Lambda:**  
   - Installed dependencies (`requests`) locally and uploaded as Lambda layers.  
   - Authenticated with Spotify API to fetch artist albums & track details.  
   - Converted data to CSV and uploaded to S3.  

2. **Database (MySQL on RDS):**  
   - Connected MySQL Workbench to RDS.  
   - Created tables and loaded data from S3.

3. **Analysis & Insights:**  
   - Identified the most active artists in 2024.  
   - Analyzed seasonal trends in music releases.
