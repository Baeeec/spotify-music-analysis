# Spotify Analysis â€“ Charlie Puthâ€™s Music Trends ðŸŽµ

## Overview  
This project analyzes Charlie Puth's music trends using Spotify API data, AWS (Lambda, S3, RDS), Python (Pandas), MySQL (RDS), and Tableau.

## Technologies Used  
- **AWS Lambda (Python)**: Handling API calls, fetching and processing Spotify data
- **S3 & RDS**: Storing structured data  
- **MySQL**: Cleaning, transforming, and analyzing data  
- **Tableau**: Creating visualizations and dashboards for insights

## Process  
1. **Data Extraction & Storage (AWS Lambda & S3):**  
   - Installed required dependencies (`requests`, `sqlalchemy`, `pymysql`) locally and uploaded them as Lambda layers.
   - Authenticated with the Spotify API and used the artist name "Charlie Puth" to fetch artist, album, and track details from multiple API endpoints.
   - Processed and structured the data into CSV format.
   - Uploaded the CSV files to an Amazon S3 bucket for storage.

2. **Data Loading & Database Integration (AWS Lambda & RDS MySQL):**
   - Connected to Amazon S3 to access the stored CSV data.
   - Established a connection with Amazon RDS (MySQL database) using `sqlalchemy` and `pymysql`.
   - Created a MySQL table in RDS and loaded the CSV data into it.
     
3. **Database (MySQL on RDS)**
   - Connected MySQL Workbench to RDS for validation and queries.
   - Cleaned data (handled nulls, converted formats, removed duplicates).
   - Performed SQL queries for data analysis.

5. **Visualization with Tableau:**  
   - Connected Tableau to the RDS MySQL database.
   - Created 6 charts & a dashboard to visualize key insights.
